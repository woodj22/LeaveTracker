# LeaveTracker

This project uses the django REST framework to provide a group of endpoints for updating and accessing an employee's annual leave. 

## Motivation

I often find it hard to learn new things when the code i am writing has no practical or real usable application. This is why I think that moving to a more meater project should happen soon after learning how to cross the t's and dot the i's of a language syntax.

When I came to learning python, the django framework gives me a structure to learn python practical API creation and a wide online community to get me up and running.

## Installation

To install, clone the repository and install all requirements of a django project. then from within the project folder:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
## Tests
